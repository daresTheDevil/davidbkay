# Leadership and management

To hit the ground running, it's always helpful for me to have and give a good first impression. All workplaces are complex places full of equally complex humans. I enjoy and expect time to meet everyone, go to every meeting, write things down, and ask all the questions.

## An Average Week

I enjoy weekly 1:1 meetings with managers and employees. A quick, 30 minute meeting can always help to keep a check on the pulse of our organization.

Staff meetings are also important. They help define expectations and make sure everyone's on the same page. Once a week should work.

You can Slack me 24 hours a day. I like responding quickly.

If I am traveling, I will give you notice of said travel in advance.

I usually work late nights and sometimes on weekends. This is my choice. **I do not expect that you are going to work on the weekend.**.

## What makes me tick

**Humans first.** I believe that happy, informed, and productive humans build fantastic product. I optimize for the humans. Other leaders will maximize the business, the technology, or any other number of important facets. Ideological diversity is key to an effective team. All perspectives are relevant, and we need all these leaders, but my bias is towards building productive humans.

**Leadership comes from everywhere.** I’ve wasted a lot of time in poorly run meetings by bad managers. As an engineer, I remain skeptical of managers even as a manager. While I believe managers are an essential part of a scaling organization, I don’t believe they have a monopoly on leadership, and I work hard to build other constructs and opportunities in our teams for non-managers to effectively lead.

**I see things as systems.** I reduce all complex things (including humans) into systems. I think in flowcharts. I take great joy in attempting to understand how these systems and flowcharts all fit together. When I see large or small inefficiencies in systems, I’d like to fix them with your help.

**It is important to me that humans are treated fairly.** I believe that most humans are trying to to do the right thing, but unconscious bias leads them astray. I work hard to understand and address my biases because I understand their ability to create inequity.

**I heavily bias towards action.** Long meetings where we are endlessly debating potential directions are often valuable, but I believe starting is the best way to begin learning and make progress. This is not always the correct strategy. This strategy annoys those who like to debate.

**I believe in the compounding awesomeness of continually fixing small things.** I believe quality assurance is everyone’s responsibility and there are bugs to be fixed everywhere… all the time.

**I start with an assumption of positive intent for all involved.** This has worked out well for me over my career. 

## Feedback

I firmly believe that feedback is at the core of building trust and respect in a team.

This includes yearly feedback to define expectations and judge whether previous expectations have been met.

Disagreement is feedback and the sooner we learn how to efficiently disagree with each other, the sooner we’ll trust and respect each other more. Ideas don’t get better with agreement.

## Meetings

I go to a lot of meetings. My definition of a meeting includes an agenda and/or intended purpose, the appropriate amount of productive attendees, and a responsible party running the meeting to a schedule. If I am attending a meeting, I’d prefer starting on time. If I am running a meeting, I will start that meeting on time. If it’s not clear to me why I am in a meeting, I will ask for clarification on my attendance. 

If you send me a presentation deck a reasonable amount of time before a meeting, I will read it before the meeting and will have my questions at the ready. If I haven’t read the deck, I will tell you.

If a meeting completes its intended purpose before it’s scheduled to end, let’s give the time back to everyone. If it’s clear the intended goal won’t be achieved in the allotted time, let’s stop the meeting before time is up and determine how to finish the meeting later.

## Nuance

**I am an introvert** and that means that prolonged exposure to humans is exhausting for me. Weird, huh? Meetings with three of us are perfect, three to eight are ok, and more than eight you will find that I am strangely quiet. Do not confuse my quiet with lack of engagement.

**When I'm asked or I ask you to do something that feels poorly defined** I will and you should ask me for both clarification and a call on importance. I might still be brainstorming. These questions can save everyone a lot of time.

**Ask assertive versus tell assertive.** When you need to ask me to do something, ask me. I respond incredibly well to ask assertiveness (“David, can you help?”). I respond poorly to being told what to do (“David, do this.”) I have been this way since I was a kid.

**I can be hyperbolic** but it’s almost always because I am excited about the topic. I also swear sometimes. Sorry.

**I love to start new things** but I often lose interest when I can mentally see how the thing is going to finish which might be weeks or month the thing is actually done. Sorry. I’m getting better at this.

**If I am on my phone during a meeting for more than 30 seconds, say something.** My attention wanders.

**Humans stating opinions as facts** are a trigger for me.

**Humans who gossip** are a trigger for me.
