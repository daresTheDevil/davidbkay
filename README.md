I spend lots of time leading and mentoring teammates. I also have very important beliefs that, 
while not immutable, are common enough to be habitual. I also expect you to hold me accountable
to these ideas.

**I'm measured by the success of my tactics.** Our strategy is often out of our hands, but I'm usually the person that defines the
feasibility of a strategy. Assuming it's feasible, I lay out the strategy needed to achieve that goal. Sometimes that involves 
a new way of doing operations; sometimes it's a more modern dev language, library or implementation. I connect the dots between
ideas, technology and people.

**Here's what our product does** and **here's what you can do with our product** sound similar, but they're completely different. We shouldn't build products for their own sake...let's build products that improve people's lives.

**Humans first.** I believe that happy, informed, and productive humans build fantastic products. I optimize for the humans. Other leaders will maximize the business, the technology, or any other number of important facets. Ideological diversity is key to an effective team. All perspectives are relevant, and we need all these leaders, but my bias is towards building and working with productive humans.

**Leadership comes from everywhere.** I’ve wasted a lot of time in poorly run meetings by bad managers. As an engineer, I remain skeptical of managers, even as a manager. While I believe managers are an essential part of a scaling organization, I don’t believe they have a monopoly on leadership, and I work hard to build other constructs and opportunities in our teams for non-managers to effectively lead.

**I see things as systems.** I reduce all complex things (including humans) into systems. I think in flowcharts. I take great joy in attempting to understand how these systems and flowcharts all fit together. When I see large or small inefficiencies in systems, I’d like to fix them with everyone's help.

**It is important to me that humans are treated fairly.** I believe that most humans are trying to to do the right thing, but unconscious bias leads them astray. I work hard to understand and address my biases because I understand their ability to create inequity.

**I heavily bias towards action.** Long meetings where we are endlessly debating potential directions are often valuable, but I believe starting is the best way to begin learning and make progress. This is not always the correct strategy. This strategy annoys those who like to debate.

**I believe in the compounding awesomeness of continually fixing small things.** I believe quality assurance is everyone’s responsibility and there are bugs to be fixed everywhere, all the time.

**I start with an assumption of positive intent for all involved.** This has worked out well for me over my career.

**The one wo(man) startup** mindset gives us the ability to quickly change direction when we're needed. We don't control our strategy, so we must
adapt to ever changing requirements from schools, districts, the legislature and the federal government.

**Optimize for the customer first, product second, project third and the task level last.** Most people operate at the task level without optimizing
for the project ("it'll be done when it's done"). Others optimize at the project level without understanding how the project or its timeline is affected. 
Almost noone questions how our product improves people's lives. That's part of my job.

**Conflicts are crucial for growth.** Don't be afraid to call people out in a respectful way. If you see something that's not right, point it out.
Be kind and constructive, but don't hold back.

**I am an introvert** and that means that prolonged exposure to humans is exhausting for me. Meetings with three of us are perfect, three to eight are ok,and more than eight you will find that I am strangely quiet. Do not confuse my quiet with lack of engagement.

**When I'm asked to do something that feels poorly defined** I will for both clarification and a call on importance. I might still be brainstorming. These questions can save everyone a lot of time.

**Ask assertive versus tell assertive.** When you need to ask me to do something, ask me. I respond incredibly well to ask assertiveness (“David, can you help?”). I respond poorly to being told what to do (“David, do this.”) I have been this way since I was a kid.

**I can be hyperbolic** but it’s almost always because I am excited about the topic. I also swear sometimes. Sorry.

**I love to start new things**. However, one of my bad habits is losing interest once I see how things are going to turn out and the problems are fixed. I recognize this as a flaw and I’m working on it.

**Being busy is not a desired outcome.** Let's do the right things for the right reasons. If we're in a lull, learn something new or help someone else.

**If I am on my phone during a meeting for more than 30 seconds, say something.** My attention wanders.

**No broken windows.** Products should have clean logs, clean exceptions, clean PagerDuty. It's easier to find and diagnose problems when our 
house is in order.

**Humans stating opinions as facts** are a trigger for me.

**Humans who gossip** are a trigger for me.

**I'm a veteran.** From a family of veterans. Don't assume anything about my political views...you'll probably be wrong. And no, you can't wear your american flag shirt to work. Yes I will say something.



# The Long Version

I believe in an office that recognizes and celebrates the creativity and collaboration of team members and the diversity of skills, talents, experiences, cultures, and opinions that they bring to our company. I also believe that digital services follow repeatable patters, and if we can identify, document, implement and improve shared strategies, we can be better.

## How 

My skillset spans wide across almost all IT disciplines. I can plan, design, develop, manage and repair most systems. Here's what we can do to make a better organization.

### Management

It's important never to forget that I manage ***people***. This doesn't mean they work for me, it means that I work for them.

#### Acquire, deploy and sustain a technology enabled workforce

We must define and identify our capabilities to forecast staffing needs and effectively plan for future hiring. We should work in a way that makes us an employer where employees ***WANT*** to work and come to us. That being said, we must streamline recruitment, hiring & onboarding processes to make employees feel welcome. IT employees must constantly learn to continue providing first-class digital services, therefore we must allow them to train & learn to increase their own value and the value of the company.

#### Structure contracts and budgets for delivery

Projects must be planned in a modular way so that, should outside contracting or services be required, requirements can be easily defined and outside proposals can be well defined and cost effective.

#### Understand users' needs

IT personnel make many assumptions about the way users will interact with their products. A successful manager on a successful project will always consider how his ***USERS***, not his employees will use the system. I love hallway tests and integrating customers' views and opinions when planning products.

#### Ensure service ownership

One person should be the leader of every product. This is not to point blame, but to encourage ownership and promote pride in products, processes and team members.

#### Use data for decisions

Back to the issue of assumptions...managers can often make decisions based on popularity (Gartner's magic quadrant) or gut feelings. A robust monitoring and alerting framework can help a manager discover and develop the right products and workflows to enable his teams to work at their best.

### Development

Large development projects fail when developers make assumptions and aren't open to change. Some of these problems can be resolved through agile program management, but many of those issues fall on developers.

#### Address the user experience

IT employees use technology everyday, and therefore we sometimes make decisions based on our perspective and assumptions. We must break out of this mold and develop with the input of end-users since their experience will ultimately decide if a project is successful. If users must be extensively trained to use a product, it's time to rethink the user interface and design to improve the user experience.

#### Be modular, composable, simple & intuitive

Intuitive applications make for happy users, and happy users make successful products. Creating smaller, modular applications with well defined scopes allow us to combine application components to solve problems in new and innovative ways. If workflows and processes are well defined, modular components can be easily improved or replaced with little or no effect on the end-user. Simplicity and composability allow us to focus on workflows instead of technologies, off-loading repeatable processes to operations and allowing developers to focus on building beautiful, usable, secure and innovative applications.

#### Be iterative

When technology only changed annually, it was easy to plan software projects from inception to delivery. Today, technologies planned for at the inception of a project can realistically no longer exist at the end of multi-year projects. Being iterative allows us to elicit constant feedback from employees, management and users to develop better products and improve delivery.

#### Develop with flexible hosting in mind

Modern virtual and container technologies allow software to be developed in a way that ensures that infrastructure is constant from a developer's machine, through the testing process and into production. Software bugs are caught earlier in development and ultimately fixed before production. Flexible hosting development also empowers a customer to be open-minded with regards to hosting on-prem or in the cloud, and promotes disaster recovery by allowing an application to run on any available platform.

#### Automate testing & deployments

Git revolutionized the way teams collaborated in software development. Automated testing and deployments have revolutionized application quality and availability. Automated testing and feedback ensures problems are caught early in the development process, and automating deployments ensures that software problems and bugs can be fixed in hours or days instead of weeks or months.

#### Address security & privacy early in the development process

Most modern applications deal with sensitive information in some way...whether personal information in a student information system or financial information in the case of an online store. Modern data privacy regulations such as GDPR levy stiff fines on companies who don't successfully protect user information. Secure coding standards, static code analysis and active security and penetration testing can highlight malformed input handling, flawed business logic and authentication/authorization manipulation. This early testing can help guide security focused architecture principles and security response policies.

### Engineering and operations

My background in systems engineering for the DoD means I have some seemingly incongruent skillsets:

1. I love to plan and implement standards-based solutions. Rarely are we the first people to do something...stand on the shoulders of giants.
2. I prefer to work with little or no supervision, and I'm not afraid to create and implement novel, unexpected solutions to problems.
3. I firmly believe in root cause analysis, after action reporting and blameless post mortems.

To enable informed decisions, we must:

#### Develop enterprise monitoring and support responses

This is a simple, but often overlooked, part of a successful digital services organization. We must know what our systems are doing at all times. We must set sane defaults and ensure our systems inform us when systems fall outside of our established parameters. This includes everything from network throughput to server performance to application availability. Alerts must also link to documented, practiced and tested response and disaster recovery plans that can be implemented by multiple employees in the case of primary employees not being available.

#### Use the right tool for the right job

Most problems in IT service organizations stem from unhappy employees. IT workers are particular about their tools and when they're forced to use unfamiliar or inelegant tools, productivity and happiness suffers. We should be open to the use of all appropriate tools, whether open-source, commercial or developed in-house.
